A quick tutorial for adb

adb appears to date back to V6 UNIX, perhaps even earlier.  It is
a simple, brutal assembly language debugger.  I have cloned it for
VSTa simply so I could exercise the debugging interfaces of VSTa.
It is an incomplete clone, but an adb user should be able to run
it through its paces without too much trouble.

For the rest of you, here are the available commands:

[<addr>], [<count>] / [<fmt>]
[<addr>], [<count>] ? [<fmt>]		(white space is ignored)
	- Examine memory.  '/' looks at actual process core; '?' looks
	  at the a.out file.

<fmt> is:
	x, X	- Dump hex, 16-bit or 32-bit respectively
	d, D	- Dump decimal
	o, O	- Dump octal
	s	- Dump strings
	S	- Dump strings with escaping of control chars
	i	- Disassemble i386 instructions

<addr> and <count> are remembered.  If you don't specify them, you
will get the old value.  Actually, if you specify just <addr>,
<count> resets to 1.  If you enter a blank line, the previous command
is executed again.  After display, <addr> advances to the next location
not seen.  Thus, "main?i" followed by return, return, return... will
disassemble consecutive locations.

$r		- Display registers
$b		- List breakpoints
$c		- Show C stack backtrace
<addr>:b	- Set breakpoint at address
<addr>:d	- Delete breakpoint at address
:c		- Continue execution
:r [<args>]	- Start new process from a.out, break before running
		  (this is not compatible with the real adb)
$q		- Exit

adb's command line arguments are also not compatible with the true
one.  They are:

adb <a.out> [<pid>]

adb will start, reading symbols from <a.out>.  If specified, it will
attach to an existing process <pid>.  Otherwise, you can use :r to
start the a.out, and debug this process.
