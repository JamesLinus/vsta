/*
 * blk.c
 *	Routines for managing the allocation of blocks
 *
 * Not a great choice of names, but I couldn't think of anything
 * better.  block.c holds routines for buffering blocks off of the
 * underlying block device.  This file holds the routines for
 * organizing the free block pool, adding blocks to files, and
 * freeing blocks out from files.
 *
 * The basic strategy is to always allocate off the end of the
 * filesystem.  Files are always contiguous, with only one writer
 * permitted at a time.  Truncation simply zeroes out the block
 * pointer for the file, and updates the overall free block count.
 * The special case of freeing storage at the end of the filesystem
 * is handled correctly--the storage is made "really" free.
 *
 * Arguably files should coalesce automatically.  My experience
 * on V.4, however, was that this resulted in a big wait.  Usually
 * would rather have twiddled things by hand instead.  So I am
 * leaving coalescing as an off-board user command which you can
 * inflict on a filesystem as needed.
