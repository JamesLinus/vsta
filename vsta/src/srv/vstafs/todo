Make sure directory entries are not honored in EXTSIZ-allocated
	storage at end of dir file.

Make sure on file expansion that we don't read in the new space
	from disk.

Add a "first sector dirty" flag so we don't have to flush the first
	full extent just to update fs_file
	In fact, add interface of dirtying a range.  Allows for a
	bitmap in the future.

Add a "only first sector is valid" flag, so we don't have to read
	the whole 64K of a file just to do a stat--just read the
	1st sector which holds all the file information.

Directory block allocation is stupid--it will always be maximally
	fragmented.  Perhaps use a power-of-two progression when
	allocating extents?  Certainly can't use the default file
	allocation algorithm--the usage pattern is too different.

Ensure deletion of a directory can't happen unless it's empty.

Directory rename.  Does it work?

fsck--when find "lost" blocks need to add back to free list

Buffers shouldn't be moving on resize.  We should use a 64K-sized
	buffer and just munmap() (or something) the trailing pages.

Flushing as you go is wasteful.  We need a "transaction" data structure
	so we can explicitly order the writes needed to complete a
	filesystem operation safely.

The "transaction" should be tagged under the open file.  This allows
	fsync() to be turned into a "commit" of the transaction.
