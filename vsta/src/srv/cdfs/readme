		README for VSTa CDROM Filesystem


Welcome to the CDROM Filesystem for VSTa.

This file contains a short description of the VSTa CDROM filesystem,
instructions for configuring the server, and a list of associated source
files.

Bits and pieces of the CDROM filesystem server were taken from the
following sources: the VSTa wd server and the FreeBSD isofs filesystem
(in particular, iso.h and isofs_rr.h).  In addition, "INSIDE THE ISO-9660
FILESYSTEM FORMAT" (DDJ 12/92) by William Frederick Jolitz and Lynne Greer
Jolitz and the Linux isofs filesystem sources were used as references.  The
rest of the server was written from scratch by Mike Larson (larz@world.std.com).

CDROM Filesystem Introduction
-----------------------------

The VSTa CDROM Filesystem (CDFS) currently conforms to a subset of
the ISO 9660 standard (see the TODO list below for omissions).

CDFS reads blocks from a device server that supports CDROM devices
(eg, the SCSI/CAM server).

CDFS is started as follows. This can be done from the command line
(assuming the user has sufficient privileges) or from the boot.lst
file. If CDFS is started from the command line, it should be run
in the background.

	cdfs -p device_server:device_name fs/cdfs

For example, assuming that the device server is SCSI/CAM and the
device name is "sr2":

	cdfs -p cam:sr2 fs/cdfs

To actually mount a filesystem, use the following command:

	mount fs/cdfs directory_name

or from etc/fstab:

	fs/cdfs directory_name

"directory_name" is the name of an empty directory (eg., /cdfs).
