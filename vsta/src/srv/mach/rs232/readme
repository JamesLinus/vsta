Subject: Readme for the VSTa PC RS232 device server
Date: 5th October 1994
From: Dave Hudson <dave@humbug.demon.co.uk>


1.0 Introduction

This is the VSTa PC RS232 server - rs232.  This code provides serial
communications via user programmable data rates, line settings and control
signals.


2.0 Copyright

The code is copyrighted under the same terms as the VSTa kernel.  Please see
the license details provided with the kernel for more details.


3.0 Modification summary

The original rs232 server was written by Andy Valencia at the end of 1993.
This provided the most fundamental features:

	core server
	receiver/transmitter handling
	16550A FIFO handling
	baud rate control

The code was extended in 1994 by Dave Hudson to add some extra features:

	hardware handshake support
	line settings/comms parameters (data, parity, start and stop bits)
	support for UARTs on arbitrary IRQs and I/O addresses
	improved UART detection
	control of FIFO thresholds


4.0 Technical Description

The server expects to be initialised using the following mechanism:

	rs232 <com[1-4] | userdef> [opts=args] ...

The following optional parameters are available:

	baseio=<I/O-base-address>
		- sets the base I/O address used by the UART

	irq=<IRQ-number>
		- sets the Interrupt Request line used by the UART

	namer=<namer-entry>
		- sets the name used to register the server with VSTa's
		  namer

	uart=<uart-type>
		- force the UART type to one of: "8250", "16450", "16550"
		  or "16550A"

	nouarttest
		- don't attempt to test for the UART's presence.  This
		  allows some dodgy internal modems (that don't have
		  loopback testing) to be used

Example uses are as follows:

	rs232 com1
		- initialises comms with default parameters for PC COM1

	rs232 com3 irq=5 namer=tty/ttyS02
		- initialises rs232 comms with default I/O address for PC
		  COM3, but with IRQ 5 used instead of the default and
		  registers the server under the name "tty/ttyS02"

	rs232 userdef baseio=0x368 irq=11 namer=tty/silly232 uart=8250
		- initialises rs232 comms where the UARTs base I/O address
		  is 0x368, its IRQ is 11 forces the UART to only use 8250
		  features and registers under the name "tty/silly232"


Control over line state, control signals, and FIFO thresholds is acheived
via the VSTa stat (FS_STAT and FS_WSTAT) mechanism.


5.0 To Do

There are some areas that could be improved in this server:

a) Built-in hardware flow control.  This would handle say RTS/CTS control.

b) Break handling

c) Use Real-Time scheduling priority to avoid any overruns.

d) Support a mode (via stat mechanism) where line error information is
interwoven into the received data stream (every other byte as line status).

e) Support for multi-port serial cards (usually 16550A based) where a single
interrupt line is used for 2 or more UARTs.  Possibly these sort of boards
should be handled by special servers though.
