This directory previously held a boot loader "boot.exe" which
ran from under DOS and used the "boot.lst" configuration file.
VSTa is now Multiboot compliant, and the preferred boot loader
is "GRUB" (GRand Unified Bootloader).  This directory contains
a kernel usable from GRUB, as well as the other server executables
needed to boot VSTa.  See vsta/doc/roadmap.txt for more details
on configuring GRUB with VSTa.

Once you have read about GRUB, the menu.lst file provided in this
directory provides some useful examples of how to set up GRUB go
boot various operating systems, including VSTa.
