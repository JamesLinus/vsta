This is a quick roadmap of where things are and how to get things done.

0. Requirements
	I have drivers for the ST-506 "classic AT" hard disk interface.
I only have a single drive, so don't know if two drives will work.  The
display server is compiled for the CGA location of display memory, and
expects just 80x25 mode.  The keyboard driver expects the AT scan codes.
The floppy driver only supports 1.2M and 1.44M (not 360K, nor 360K in
a 1.2M drive.)  I don't have 1.44M, so again don't know if it works.
My system has 4M of RAM, and that seems to be plenty.  I load a lot more
things than necessary as boot tasks, just because it's so easy.
	You will need the DJ Delorie GNU C compiler port.  I use version
1.39, but am not aware of any particular sensitivity to version.  Probably
something will break when I first use a 2.X vintage, but feel free to try
and tell me how it goes!  I also assume you have a fairly decent "make"
program.  Mine is "nmake" from masm 6.0, but I only use very vanilla
make features in my makefiles.
	If you want to recompile the boot loader in boot/, you will
need a DOS C compiler.  It only uses small model, and doesn't do much of
anything fancy.  I happen to use Borland C and the turbo assembler
provided with it.  The program doesn't do much that needs changing,
so you should consider just using my .exe.  But the source is there,
if you want to change something.

1. Source organization
	All files are stored under RCS.  The RCS storage resides
inside the RCS/ subdir in each source directory.

For reference, here is the top-level VSTa source directory:

bfs/	      env/	    libc/	  msgfake/	sys/
bin/	      fd/	    license	  namer/	tmpfs/
boot/	      include/	    mach/	  pipe/		wd/
cons/	      kbd/	    make/	  rcs/
dbg/	      kern/	    mkall.bat*	  readme
dos/	      lib/	    mkclean.bat*  swap/

	The kernel directories (mach, kern, sys) reside at the same
level as the servers (bfs, cons, dos, env, fd, kbd, namer, pipe, swap,
tmpfs, and wd).  Kernel and user mode share the library in lib.  The
C library is in libc.  User commands are in the bin subdirectory.

2. Building the kernel
	Go into the make subdir.  Do a "make clean".  If this fails
because there's no makefile, don't worry.
	Run the kernel config program:  "go32 config".  Now you should
have a makefile.
	Run the make: "make"
	Now you have a kernel.

3. Building the world
	Go to the root, and invoke the "mkclean" batch file.
	Now invoke the "mkall" batch file.  It will move around through
the source and build things in the right order.  Currently, the GNU C
compiler isn't cleaned out or built.  It's big, and it pretty much
stays the same, since I'm not a compiler type of person.  You can go
in there and build it for yourself if you'd like.  Be careful, though,
since the output of it will be used by later invokations of the compiler
in that directory--I usually build a pass (gcc, or cc1, or cpp) and
then move it immediately to the c:\bin directory (c:\bin isn't even in
my DOS path--I use d:\bin instead).  Similarly for "gas", which is
in its own directory, and "ld", which is in binutl.

4. Putting a boot filesystem in place
	Initial binaries are in the root directory in root.t, which
is a tar file.  You need to extract this in the root dir of your first
ST-506 DOS partition.  Sorry about using the bin/ dir, but VSTa
executables don't have an extension so it shouldn't interfere even if
you already have DOS executables there.
	Passwords are in /etc/passwd, and are in the clear.  Feel free
to edit this file using a DOS editor; VSTa tries to accomodate both
DOS \r\n and UNIX \n conventions for line-oriented data.  The format
is described in lib/passwd.c.  The group you belong to in the passwd
file causes you to get more abilities; see /etc/group.  Finally,
numeric format IDs are mapped to symbolic courtesy of /etc/ids.  You
can see how in lib/ids.c.

3. Booting the kernel
	Move to the "boot" subdir.
	Invoke the batch file "go".
	This will load the kernel in ..\make, and also load the
boot servers listed in boot.lst.  All the servers should have been
built by the "mkall", so there should be no problems.

4. Kernel debugger
	Debugging comes out of COM1 at 9600 baud 8N1.  Use the "pr"
command to see the proc table, the "bt" command to see a stack back-
trace of the current process.  "dv" will dump virtual addresses,
and "dp" will dump physical.  You can look at the current user process'
address space by OR'ing in 0x80000000 to the user address.  "dv" will
complain if you try to look at a non-existent address.  "di" will dis-
assemble at an address; symbols were put in during the kernel build,
so the output should be fairly comprehensible (if you know i386 assembly!)
The "=" will take expressions and print them in hex, decimal, and
symbolically.
	"pr <num>" will dump out a particular process with more detail.
"vas <addr>" will dump out a virtual address space struct; similarly for
"pset", "pview", "port", "ref" (portref).  "tf" will dump out the current
trapframe (from the last trip through trap()), or "tf <addr>" will
assume there's a trap frame at the given address, and dump it out
instead.

5. More?
	No doubt, but I can't think of what might help the most.
Stay in touch!
