This is a quick roadmap of where things are and how to get things done.

0. Requirements
	I have a driver for the ST-506 "classic AT" hard disk interface.
This driver has also been verified with one and two disk IDE systems
(although two disk IDE is *begging* for trouble, in most people's
experience.)  The disk geometry can be obtained via (1) the controller's
"read parameter" command, (2) the NVRAM/BIOS stored disk parameters,
or (3) by hand-entering the disk parameters.  Detailed instructions
are in the boot.lst file, discussed below.

	Mike Larson has written a SCSI disk driver for the Adaptec
1542[bc] interface.  IDE and SCSI appear to co-exist without problems.

	The console driver supports both MGA and CGA text screen
locations.  It is not currently auto-detect.  The keyboard driver
expects the AT scan codes.  The floppy driver only supports 1.2M and
1.44M (not 360K, nor 360K in a 1.2M drive.) I don't have 1.44M, so again
don't know if it works.  My system has 4M of RAM, and that seems to be
plenty.  Systems with up to 16 Meg have been booted.  There is code for
> 16 M, but it has not been tested and is certainly not complete.

	Unlike past releases, you do not need the DJ Delorie GNU C
compiler port for DOS.  If you *do* use it, make sure you get an older
version which generates a.out format.  Later versions use COFF, which
is incompatible.

	The binaries distributed with VSTa include a port of the GNU
C compiler.  Self-hosted VSTa compiles are the method of choice.  But
since you now get precompiled versions of all the servers, commands,
and libraries you can skip self-hosted compiles if you just want to play
with the running system.  Or you can choose just to recompile interesting
parts.

	If you want to recompile the boot loader in boot/, you will
need a DOS C compiler.  It uses large model, but doesn't do much of
anything fancy.  I happen to use Borland C and the turbo assembler
provided with it.  The program doesn't do much that needs changing,
so you should consider just using my .exe.  But the source is there,
if you want to change something.

1. Loading the VSTa files onto your disk.

	Make the directory /vsta under DOS.  This should be the first
DOS partition on whatever disk you happen to be using.  If you don't
have the DOS versions of gzip or tar, you can probably find them
in the same place you found vsta.tz and vsta_bin.tz.

	mkdir \vsta
	cd \vsta
	(Copy the vsta_bin.tz here)
	gzip -dv vsta_bin.tz
	tar -xvf vsta_bin.t
	del vsta_bin.t
	(Copy vsta.tz here now)
	gzip -dv vsta.tz
	tar -xvf vsta.t
	del vsta.t

	You now have all the binaries and source for VSTa.

	Passwords are in /vsta/etc/passwd, and are in the clear.  Feel
free to edit this file using a DOS editor; VSTa tries to accomodate both
DOS \r\n and UNIX \n conventions for line-oriented data.  The format
is described in lib/passwd.c.  The group you belong to in the passwd
file causes you to get more abilities; see /vsta/etc/group.  Finally,
numeric format IDs are mapped to symbolic courtesy of /vsta/etc/ids.  You
can see how in libc/ids.c.

2. VSTa directory organization

	All source files are stored under RCS.  The RCS storage resides
inside the RCS/ subdir in each source directory.  The binary directories,
of course, are not kept under RCS.

	The VSTa tree is organized under /vsta as:

	os/		Kernel source
	os/make		Where objects are compiled into
	os/kern		Portable C source
	os/mach		i386 C, as well as assembly
	srv/		All portable servers (filesystems, etc.)
	srv/mach	i386/ISA servers (disk, keyboard, etc.)
	bin.src/	Command source
	libc/		Library source
	bin/		Commands
	lib/		Libraries
	etc/		System-oriented text files
	doc/		Documentation, such as it is
	doc/man		Some initial man pages, in roff format

3. Booting the kernel

	cd to the "/vsta/boot" subdir.

	Edit the file "boot.lst".  Each boot driver has a line here,
and the comments before each line should tell you how to fiddle
the line to reflect your hardware.  Currently, you need to edit
console driver to tell it whether you're CGA or MGA, and you need
to edit the line for the wd disk driver to tell it how to get
the parameters for your disk(s).  Or comment out the wd driver and
uncomment the SCSI driver "cam" instead.  Or use both.

	Invoke the batch file "go.bat".

	This will load the kernel and boot servers from the boot
directory, as listed in your boot.lst.  The /vsta/boot directory
has pre-built versions of all servers.  For future reference,
the "make install" target in teach server makefile will copy it
over to /vsta/boot.

4. Kernel debugger

	You have two options for kernel debugging.  As shipped,
the on-screen kernel debugger is selected.  If you want to have
the kernel debugger talk out the serial port, see os/mach/dbg*.c.
You will also have to change the compilation options if you're using
a display card at the MGA text address.

	You will enter the debugger if VSTa crashes.  You can also
type ^Z (control-Z) and you'll drop into it.  A "q" will continue.
Since the console driver handles this, it'll try to restore your screen
after you come back from the debugger.

	Use the "pr" command to see the proc table, the "bt" command
to see a stack backtrace of the current process.  "dv" will dump virtual
addresses, and "dp" will dump physical.  You can look at the current
user process' address space by OR'ing in 0x80000000 to the user address.
"dv" will complain if you try to look at a non-existent address.  "di"
will disassemble at an address; symbols were put in during the kernel
build, so the output should be fairly comprehensible (if you know i386
assembly!)  The "=" will take expressions and print them in hex, decimal,
and symbolically.

	"pr <num>" will dump out a particular process with more detail.
"vas <addr>" will dump out a virtual address space struct; similarly for
"pset", "pview", "port", "ref" (portref).  "tf" will dump out the current
trapframe (from the last trip through trap()), or "tf <addr>" will
assume there's a trap frame at the given address, and dump it out
instead.

5. Multi-screens

	By default two logins are launched for two virtual screens.
Use ALT-F1 and ALT-F2 to switch between the screens.  See the file
/vsta/etc/inittab to launch more screens.  The first screen (ALT-F1)
also receives syslog output.

6. Building the system

	Boot VSTa
	cd /vsta
	mkall
	(watch the blinkin lights)
	(if all looks great:)
	mkall install

	You can also cd to some particular server or command source
directory and "make" or "make install" just that piece.

	NOTE: some binaries (emacs, rc, gcc & friends) are in their
own distribution tar file.  They may not even be present in your source
tree.

7. Documentation

	Regrettably, not much.  Use the "man" command to access the
initial man pages.  Hopefully more will show up, but at least the
messaging primitives are now documented.  You can list the available
man entries with "man 2 msg", and see msg_receive() documentation
with "man msg_receive" (or "man 2 msg_receive").

	The /vsta/doc/man directory will show you which man pages exist.
There are also some files in /vsta/doc (like this one), but nothing
earth shaking.  The C is pretty thoroughly commented, which'll help
programmers.  I'm not sure VSTa's ready for non-programmers, but you're
welcome to give it a try.

8. More?

	No doubt, but I can't think of what might help the most.
