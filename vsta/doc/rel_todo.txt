5. "cd vsta/src" and "sh mkall.sh"

7. Reboot and verify things still work
8. "cd vsta/src" and "sh mkall.sh clobber"
9. "cd vsta", mount something on /dist, and "make -f mkdist.mk"
10. Put the install packages on my test machine and do a scratch install
11. Push it out to the FTP server
12. See if there are any new packages, and put links in the WWW page
