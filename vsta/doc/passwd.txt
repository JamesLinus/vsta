There are quite a number of files related to user accounts and
their associated attributes.  This document gives a quick summary
of what goes where, and does what.

/vsta/etc/passwd

The passwd file is the central database concerning user accounts.  A
typical line in the passwd file looks like:

vandys:*:1:0:Andy Valencia:usr.vandys:/vandys:vandys:/vsta/bin/sh

The first field, "vandys", is the username.  This is what you enter
to the login program.

The second field, "*", is the password field.  Passwords are not
actually stored in /vsta/etc/passwd, but rather in /vsta/etc/shadow.
More on this below.

The third field, "1", is the "user ID".  In UNIX, this would define
what files you can access, but not so in VSTa.  Rather, in VSTa,
the "UID" is simply that: an ID related to one particular logged
in user.  It is used to answer questions like "who created this
file?", but not "who can read this file?".

The fourth field, "0", is the "group ID".  This ID indicates a
specific group in /vsta/etc/group (documented below).  By being
a member of a particular group, you get capabilities.  So a set
of capabilities suitable for some particular group of accounts is
described in /vsta/etc/group for a given group ID.  Then, each user
account has the same group ID, and they all share those capabilities.

The fifth field, "Andy Valencia", is simply a textual description of
the person using the account.

The sixth field, "usr.vandys", lists your initial capability.  The
capability name is hierarchical, and is a reference to the numerical
counterpart, looked up via /vsta/etc/ids.  So after you log in, your
capabilities are the sum of this one, plus any additional ones granted
due to your group ID.

The seventh field, "/vandys", is your home directory.  $HOME gets set
to this.

The eighth field, "vandys", is your environment path.  Very much unlike
UNIX, your environment is kept in an external server, which is global
to the system.  A given user's environment variables exist under /env
with the given name--/env/vandys, in this case.  Each variable shows
up as a simple file within that directory.

The ninth field, "/vsta/bin/sh", is your default shell.  $SHELL will be
set to it, and after successful login this is what will be launched as
your command interpreter.

/vsta/etc/shadow

The shadow file has the same format as the passwd file, but most of the
fields are left empty.  The entry corresponding to passwd's example would
be:

vandys:glarfl:::::::

Which simply encodes that user account "vandys" has the password "glarfl".
The reason these two files exist is so that the shadow file can be
given file permissions such that the average user can not read it.  The
passwd file is left public so that programs like "ls" can convert user
ID's to user names.

/vsta/etc/ids

ID's and capabilities are very central to protection in VSTa.  This file
describes ID's, mapping from symbolic names to numbers.  The portion of
the file concerning the "vandys" account (usr.vandys) is:

usr:3
	vandys:1
	jtk:2

So if you're "usr.vandys", numerically you're actually "3.1".  How are
these used?  See the section "How do capabilities work?" in the file
/vsta/doc/faq.

/vsta/etc/group

The group ID referenced in the passwd file picks a line from this
file.  The line for "vandys"'s group (0) is:

root:0:sys.sys

This gives a name ("root") to group 0, and then lists capabilities
which should be granted to any member of this group.  In this
case, the single capability "sys.sys" is granted.  So for account
"vandys", any file which could be accessed by either "usr.vandys"
*or* by "sys.sys" will be accessible.  There can be zero or more
capabilities (separated by further colons).
